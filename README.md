Remove Rob Ford from your Web

If you like news but are tired of pretty much anything Toronto's Bob and Doug
Ford have to contribute to the public sphere, this Greasemonkey script is for
you.

It is currently tested and working on the following news sites:
  - the Toronto Star (www.thestar.com)
  - the Globe and Mail (www.theglobeandmail.com)
  - the National Post (www.nationalpost.com)

It seeks out references to "Rob Ford", "Doug Ford", and "Ford Nation", and
removes them.

Requirements
------------
Firefox with Greasemonkey installed:
  - www.mozilla.org/download
  - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/

Known or Suspected Issues
-------------------------
This hasn't (yet) been tested with HTTPS-Everywhere, which is likely to break
the URL matching.
